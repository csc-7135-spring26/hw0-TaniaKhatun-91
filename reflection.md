# HW0 Reflection

## What I learned
- Github is distributed version control system (VCS). It is very useful in tracking changes to our code, collaborating, and sharing the code with others. It hosts repositories online.
- Repositories store files. We can add a README file to our repository to tell other people why our project is useful, what they can do with our project, and how they can use it. 
- I created a new branch called `hw0-reflection`.
- In that branch, I created a Markdown file called `reflection.md`.
- When I make changes on my local machine, I need to commit them, and then push them to GitHub so they appear in the repository.
- Branches let me work on changes without affecting `main`.
- Pull requests are used to submit changes for review and to merge changes into `main`.


## What I am still confused about
- What I should do when merge conflicts happen
